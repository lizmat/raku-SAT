  + Documentation and README. Make a dummy class for testing dispatch of the
    interface definitions. That class can also be used to test the testing
    routines.

  + Like SAT::Solver modules can provide solvers with or without witnesses,
    SAT::Counter should make provisions to support approximate counters.

  + Maybe implement pure-perl solvers of every kind in here to have (slow)
    fallbacks.
