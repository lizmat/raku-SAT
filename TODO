  + Documentation and README. Test the testing routines?

  + Define common error types for solvers.

  + Like SAT::Solver modules can provide solvers with or without witnesses,
    SAT::Counter should make provisions to support approximate counters.

  + Maybe implement pure-perl solvers of every kind in here to have (slow)
    fallbacks.
